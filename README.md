## List



We must have a user register or login and then they will be able to create a list of their choosing. From adding a list they can go to that list and add items with notes to ensure that the items needed within the list are correct and also any addition information they may need about that item can be accessable to them as well. Users can also check items off of the list when they have picked up the desired item.

1. First, we must have a user authenticate themselves which was achieved by the default authentication that Microsoft provides for us.

2. Once the user authenticates themselves they will be taken to the home screen where they can then go to their list(s) and add or delete items and refine their list.

3. After the user is at the home screen they then click the list button and will be directed to the page where all of their list are stored. A user can go add, remove, view details, or edit the list.
